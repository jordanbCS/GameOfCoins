# GameOfCoins  

Cryptographic currencies are going to offer a tangible lesson to those of this world who have not yet beheld the void of unpredictability that is our future. Currencies are defined by their transformations with other currencies. This feature, along with the awesome number of ways to parameterize a currency, makes it very hard to know what kind of coin dynamics at any given time would serve as "optimal" facilitators of some form of a common goal. 

## Level 1: A game of password  

The objective is to bootstrap your way into the password managers of your opponents. If you were to get one password, than that could open up some accounts that get you to more important passwords.  
One game mechanic would address the problem of correlated passwords. Imagine that I have a password template that I use. It allows me to have particular passwords for particular sites, but it also mutually weakens my passwords because a password cracker could theoretically derive any linking rules that might correlate my passwords.  
At the start of the game you run your own personal passwords through several different distance metrics (like Levenshtein distance, or any statistical/algorithmic distance function), and the correlations between your passwords, given the particular distance metric, is what the other players are trying to determine in order to get your more important passwords.

## Level 2: A game of election  

How actually are decisions made about Bitcoin code? I have no idea but it must assuredly be unsustainable chaos. The goal of this level is to maximize the completion of shared goals of the "true" denizens of a currency community. 

Start by exchanging trust tokens with your friends. These tokens could be signatures, acting as upvotes, connected with your friends' wallet addresses, or they could be the rights to some blockchain asset. Increase the value of your trust tokens by reliably, and singularly, indicating your ranked preferences for decisions relating to the distribution of equity within the currency community.


## Level 3: A game of association  

The goal of this level is to develop models of a currency's network effect. To truly predict the fluctuations of a coin's value, one must account for its network centrality among the other coins. Bancor, for instance, would seem ideally situated to becoming a significant reserve. Ultimately, there is nothing stopping a competitor to Bancor from launching, which is why network centrality is something we'd like to subtract from our predictive models.  

## Level 4: A game of orientation  

## Level 5: A game of neurons

## Level 6: A game of negotiation  

## Level 7: A game of intention 

## Level 8: A game of space and time
